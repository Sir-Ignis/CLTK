# CLTK
Command Line Toolkit

CLTK is eventually going to be a collection of useful tools
designed to run in UNIX terminals. Currently, CLTK only consists of
a password generator tool and a system information tool;
more tools will be added later.

## Password Generator 
**requires libsodium**, read more about libsodium [here](https://libsodium.org).

## System Info
**requires libcurl**, read more about libcurl [here](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/).
